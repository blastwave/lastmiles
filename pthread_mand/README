The idea here is to load up the POSIX thread work queue model with a
pile of work that represents the computation needed on a region of the
mandlebrot fractal. 

At the moment the region of the mandlebrot in previous code tests was
rendered on screen as a 1024 x 1024 square pixel grid. Each pixel may
represent a single sample computation or an average of a set or even
a statistical model applied to a set. Regardless we generally break
up the work into regions of smaller work. Previously we used a sample
grid that was 16 x 16 smaller squares inside the mandlebrot region of
interest.  Consider the following trivial case : 

    magnify = 64 = m

     centre = ( -1.75, 0.0 ) = ( r0, c0 )

The mandlebrot is only of interest within a circle of radius 2 and at
the origin and thus we generally think that a magnify of 1 will cover
a region on the complex place from ( -2, -2 ) to ( 2, 2 ) and thus we
have a square width and height of 4 units.  The magnify value of 64
simply means that this width and height are divided by 64 to give us
a region centered at ( -1.75, 0.0 ) with a width and height of 4/64
or simply 1/16th of a unit.  What are the complex coordinates of the
lower left corner of this region?

       real lower left = rll = r0 - 1/2 * ( 4 / m )
                             = -1.75 - 2 / m
                             = -1.75 - 2 / 64
                             = -1.78125

    complex lower left = cll = c0 - 1/2 * ( 4 / m )
                             = 0.0 - 2 / m
                             = 0.0 - 2 / 64
                             = -0.03125
