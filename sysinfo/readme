Bizarre off the cuff test to show that malloc may spit in
your coffee and kick your dog and just because you free 
a buffer or think it will be zero ... think again.

While we are at it let's try to allocate ALL available
memory and also flush memory in bit patterns and maybe
even push swap a little.

From the man page for "bash" on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4

   ulimit [-HSTabcdefilmnpqrstuvx [limit]]
          Provides  control  over the resources available to the shell
          and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such
          control.  The -H and -S options specify that the hard or soft
          limit is set for the given  resource. A hard limit cannot be
          increased by a non-root user once it is set; a soft limit may
          be increased up to the value of the hard limit.
          If neither -H nor -S is specified, both the soft and hard
          limits are set.  The value of limit can  be a number in the
          unit specified for the resource or one of the special values
          hard, soft, or unlimited, which stand for the current hard
          limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.
          If limit is omitted, the  current value of the soft limit
          of the resource is printed, unless the -H option is given.
          When more than one resource is specified, the limit name
          and unit are printed before the value.

          Other options are interpreted as follows:
              -a     All current limits are reported
              -b     The maximum socket buffer size
              -c     The maximum size of core files created
              -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment
              -e     The maximum scheduling priority ("nice")
              -f     The maximum size of files written by the shell
                     and its children
              -i     The maximum number of pending signals
              -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
              -m     The maximum resident set size (many systems do not
                     honor this limit)
              -n     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most
                     systems do not allow this value to be set)
              -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be
                     set)
              -q     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
              -r     The maximum real-time scheduling priority
              -s     The maximum stack size
              -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
              -u     The maximum number of processes available to a
                     single user
              -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to
                     the shell and, on some systems, to its children
              -x     The maximum number of file locks
              -T     The maximum number of threads

              If limit is given, it is the new value of the specified
              resource (the -a option is display only).  If no option
              is given,  then  -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte
              increments, except for -t, which is in seconds, -p, which
              is in units of 512-byte blocks, and -T, -b, -n, and -u,
              which are unscaled values.  The return status is 0 unless
              an invalid option or argument is supplied, or an error
              occurs while setting a new limit.

              In POSIX Mode 512-byte blocks are used for the `-c' 
              and `-f' options.
